# CA Certificates Directory
#
# Place certificates here before building:
#
# 1. Corporate CA bundle (*.pem) - installed for BOTH profiles
#    Example: corp-ca-bundle.pem
#    Copied directly to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
#
# 2. Zscaler certificates (*.cer) - installed for VPN profile only
#    Example: zscaler-root.cer, zscaler-intermediate.cer
#    Converted from DER/PEM format and combined into
#    /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/zscaler-bundle.pem
#
# 3. Java trust store (*.cacerts) - installed for BOTH profiles
#    Example: corp-java.cacerts
#    Replaces $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts
